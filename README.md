# TypeDB STIX Schema

This repository contains a TypeDB schema designed to represent the [STIXâ„¢ Version 2.1](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/os/stix-v2.1-os.html) standard for cyber threat intelligence. The schema is defined across several TypeQL (`.tql`) files.

This repository is compatible with TypeDB 3.x

## Setup

Set up and run a TypeDB Server instance.

**Initialise Schema**

You can use the demo tool to initialize the database and schema by running the following command:

```
python src/main.py --address=<address> --username=<username> --password=<password> setup
```

You can also initialise the schema through TypeDB Console. Run the setup script:
```
typedb console --address=<address> --username=<username> --password=<password> --script=<path to schema/setup_script.tqls>
```

**Load Sample Data**

`typedb-cti` comes with a loading tool capable of ingesting a STIX bundle from a JSON file. To do so, run this command:

```
python src/main.py --address=<address> --username=<username> --password=<password> ingest <path to bundle.json>
```

Try ingesting `sample/salt_typhoon_stix.json` for a small dataset you can explore.

The Salt Typhoon sample data is also available as a TypeQL script. You can load it by running
```
typedb console --address=<address> --username=<username> --password=<password> --script=<path to sample/load_data.tqls>
```

## Sample queries

Here's how to write some basic TypeQL queries to answer some questions:

1) What threat actor is the attack pattern with designation "T1078" attributed to?
    Query:
    ```typeql
    match
      $attack-pattern isa attack-pattern, has name like "T1078";
      uses ($attack-pattern, $campaign);
      attributed-to ($threat-actor, $campaign);
    fetch {
      "threat actor" : $threat-actor.name,
      "campaign name": $campaign.name
    };
    ```

2) Is there an infrastructure with a "<infra>", which hosts a tool that delivers a malware, that communicates with an IPV4 address "<ip>"?
    Query:
    ```typeql
    match
      $infra isa infrastructure, has name $infra-name; 
      $infra-name == "<infra>";
      $tool isa tool, has name $tool-name;
      hosts (hosting-source: $infra, hosted-target: $tool);
      $malware isa malware, has name $malware-name;
      delivers (delivering-source: $tool, delivered-target: $malware);
      $ip isa  ipv4-addr, has ipv4_value "<ip>";
      communicates-with (communicating-source: $malware, communicated-target: $ip);
    fetch {
      "infrastructure": $infra-name,
      "tool": $tool-name,
      "malware": $malware-name
    };
    ```


## Schema Structure

The STIX standard defines various objects and their relationships. This schema maps these concepts into TypeDB's type system using entities, attributes, and relations. The schema is organized into the following files:

1.  **`properties.tql`**:
    *   Defines common low-level attributes (properties in STIX terminology) that are reused across different STIX objects. This includes basic types like strings, timestamps, lists, and controlled vocabularies (enums) specified by the STIX standard.

2.  **`domain_objects.tql`**:
    *   Defines the STIX Domain Objects (SDOs). These represent the high-level concepts in threat intelligence.
    *   Examples: `attack-pattern`, `campaign`, `course-of-action`, `identity`, `indicator`, `intrusion-set`, `malware`, `observed-data`, `threat-actor`, `tool`, `vulnerability`.
    *   Each SDO entity inherits from a base `stix-domain-object` and owns the relevant properties defined in `properties.tql` or specific attributes defined within this file.

3.  **`cyber_observable_objects.tql`**:
    *   Defines the STIX Cyber-observable Objects (SCOs). These represent the technical details and artifacts observed in the cyber domain.
    *   Examples: `artifact`, `autonomous-system`, `directory`, `domain-name`, `email-addr`, `email-message`, `file`, `ipv4-addr`, `ipv6-addr`, `mac-addr`, `mutex`, `network-traffic`, `process`, `software`, `url`, `user-account`, `windows-registry-key`, `x509-certificate`.
    *   Each SCO entity inherits from a base `stix-cyber-observable-object` and owns relevant properties.

4. **`meta_objects.tql`**
   * Defines the STIX meta objects (e.g., `marking-definition`)

5.  **`relationships.tql`**:
    *   Defines the STIX Relationship Objects (SROs), which represent connections between other STIX objects.
    *   Includes the generic `relationship` type and specific relationship types derived from it (e.g., `related-to`, `duplicate-of`).
    *   Also defines TypeDB relations that model the *linking properties* often found on SDOs and SCOs (like `created_by_ref`, `resolves_to_ref`, `belongs_to_ref`). These TypeDB relations provide a more direct and queryable link between entities compared to just storing the target object's ID in an attribute. For instance, the `resolves_to_ref` attribute on `domain-name` is modeled using a `resolves-to` relation connecting a `domain-name` entity to an `ipv4-addr` or `ipv6-addr` entity.


### Missing components

There are several missing components, mostly in things that require ordered lists in TypeDB, which are not yet implemented.

* Granular markings
  * Ordering matters for granular markings, no matter how they are implemented.
  * There are two major options for implementation: 'natively' in TypeDB, or as as simple strings interpreted by the application.

* All components that semantically conceptually require list orderings:
  * email.received-line[] 


### TypeDB-specific interpretations

- Kill chain phase 

Consultation with experts has suggested that there be globally unique kill_chain_phase entities, instead of attributes/structs.

- External references

These are modeled as entities.

#### Not yet implemented

- Extensions

Predefined extensions are cannot be modeled using native TypeDB subtypes! Instead, we need to use composition.

- Dictionaries

TypeDB doesn't have first-class support for dictionaries. As a result, we use an approximation like this, using for example 'hashes':
```
define
  entity STIX-type, # some STIX object that contains some dictionary
    plays hashes-dictionary-entry:owner;
  
  relation hashes-dictionary-entry,
    relates owner @card(1),
    owns hash_algorithm @card(1),   # key
    owns hash_value @card(1);       # value
```

Essentially, the central STIX instance that is meant to _contain_ a dictionary will instead be connected to a set of dictionary entries. This mostly works since we exactly 1 dictionary per object in STIX. A more general would introduce a dictionary entity to hold these entries, so we could connect multiple dictionaries to the same owner.

This implementation of dictionaries does not enforce uniquess of dictionary entry keys (TypeDB's uniqueness contraint is global _per type_, not conditional on any instance, for the time being.)


## Relation to STIX Standard

This schema aims to faithfully represent the structure, properties, and relationships defined in the STIX 2.1 specification. The names of entities, relations, and attributes generally follow the STIX object and property names. Relation role names have been created to try to contextualise relations "source" and "target" specifications. Refer to the official [STIX 2.1 documentation](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/os/stix-v2.1-os.html) for detailed definitions of each object and property.
